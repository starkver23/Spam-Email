# Email Spam Classification

## Introduction

This project involves the creation and training of various models to classify emails as spam or not spam. We explore different machine learning and deep learning techniques including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for this classification task.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install pandas scikit-learn tensorflow keras matplotlib

## Dataset
The dataset was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balaka18/email-spam-classification-dataset-csv

## Steps to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository

2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install pandas scikit-learn tensorflow keras matplotlib

3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts provided in the repository to train and evaluate the models.
4. Optionally, you can make predictions using the trained models.
